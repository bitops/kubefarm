# Composition of containers

An example of how to build and run Docker Compose with containers built from the local environment as well as a public git repo.

## Usage

Simply run `docker-compose up` or `make start` or simply `make` to start the containers. Use `make stop` to shut down the containers.

Once the containers are running, you can access the web endpoints by hitting the apps on either [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/) or [port 3001](http://localhost:3001/).
